# OYHustle Field Testing Plan

## Core User Flows

### 1. **Client Management Flow**
**Primary Path:**
1. Open app → Navigate to Clients tab
2. Tap "Add Client" → Fill client form (name, email, phone, address)
3. Save client → View client in list
4. Tap client → View client details
5. Edit client information → Save changes

**Testing Scenarios:**
- ✅ Valid client creation with all fields
- ⚠️ Invalid email format handling
- ⚠️ Empty required fields validation
- ✅ Client editing and updates
- ✅ Client deletion (if implemented)

### 2. **Job Management Flow**
**Primary Path:**
1. Navigate to Jobs tab → Tap "Add Job"
2. Fill job details (name, description, client, quote, dates)
3. Add tools & supplies checklist items
4. Add job notes
5. Save job → View in jobs list
6. Update job status (Quoted → Accepted → In-Progress → Completed)

**Testing Scenarios:**
- ✅ Job creation with all fields
- ⚠️ Date validation (start after quote, end after start)
- ⚠️ Quote amount validation (positive numbers)
- ✅ Job status progression
- ✅ Tools checklist functionality
- ✅ Notes editing and saving

### 3. **Expense & Receipt Flow**
**Primary Path:**
1. Open job details → Tap "Add Expense"
2. Enter expense details → Tap "Add Receipt Photo"
3. Choose camera or gallery → Capture/select receipt
4. Save expense with receipt → View in job expenses

**Testing Scenarios:**
- ✅ Expense creation with receipt photo
- ⚠️ Camera permission handling
- ⚠️ Photo library permission handling
- ✅ Receipt image display and storage
- ✅ Expense amount validation

### 4. **Payment Processing Flow**
**Primary Path:**
1. Open job details → Tap "Payment"
2. Select payment method (PayPal/GCash/Cash)
3. Enter payment amount → Process payment
4. View payment confirmation → Job status updates

**Testing Scenarios:**
- ✅ Cash payment (immediate completion)
- ⚠️ PayPal integration (mock success/failure)
- ⚠️ GCash integration (mock success/failure)
- ✅ Payment amount validation
- ✅ Job completion on full payment

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

### 1. **Permission Denials**
- **Camera Access**: App requests camera → User denies
  - Expected: Show permission dialog, fallback to gallery only
- **Photo Library**: App requests gallery → User denies
  - Expected: Show error message, allow manual entry

### 2. **Network/Offline Scenarios**
- **Offline Mode**: No internet connection
  - Expected: App works with local storage, sync when online
- **Slow Network**: Poor connectivity during image upload
  - Expected: Show loading state, timeout handling

### 3. **Data Validation**
- **Invalid Dates**: End date before start date
- **Negative Amounts**: Quote or expense with negative values
- **Empty Required Fields**: Submit forms with missing data
- **Large Image Files**: Very large receipt photos

### 4. **Storage Limits**
- **Device Storage Full**: Cannot save receipt images
- **App Data Corruption**: Invalid Redux state
